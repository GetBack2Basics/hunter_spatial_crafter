## Executive Summary

The **Hunter Spatial Crafter** repository demonstrates a cloud-native, high-performance spatial ETL and multi-criteria constraint modeling pipeline built on **Apache Sedona (PySpark)**, **Wherobots Cloud Spatial SQL**, and **GeoParquet**. Originally applied to precinct transformation in the Macquarie Coal Complex (Lake Macquarie / Hunter region), its underlying architecture provides a repeatable blueprint for NSW Government teams managing state-wide cadastral, planning, environmental, and infrastructure datasets.

By replacing traditional, desktop-bound GIS workflows with scalable distributed spatial computing, this codebase enables NSW Spatial Services and DPHI to process millions of property boundaries, environmental layers, and terrain models in seconds while maintaining full code versioning, auditability, and interoperability with the **NSW Spatial Digital Twin**.

```

### 1. Planning & Precinct Transformation (DPHI & Regional NSW)
* **Automated Net Developable Area (NDA) Calculation:**
  * **Challenge:** Manually buffering and clipping environmental, physical, and infrastructure constraints across large regional precincts (e.g., Hunter transformation, Renewable Energy Zones, TOD precincts) takes weeks in desktop GIS.
  * **Solution in Project:** `macquarie_spatial_ingest.py` automates the ingestion, buffering, and topological subtraction of water bodies, high-value biodiversity, power lines, and active rail corridors to output clean, quantified Net Developable Zones automatically.
  * **Benefit:** Reduces site assessment timelines from weeks to minutes, allowing rapid scenario modeling for state housing targets and precinct master planning.

* **5-Tier Multi-Criteria Siting & Suitability Engine:**
  * **Challenge:** Balancing competing land-use constraints (geological hazards, terrain slope, flood outfalls, grid proximity).
  * **Solution in Project:** `national_suitability_analysis.py` implements a scalable 5-tier overlay framework (Terrain/DEM, Mine Subsidence, Flood Risk, Power Infrastructure, and Protected Habitat).
  * **Benefit:** Provides an objective, mathematically rigorous spatial decision matrix that can be configured for any precinct in NSW.

### 2. Environment & Heritage (NSW SEED & Natural Resources)
* **Direct SEED & Open Data Portal Pipeline Integration:**
  * **Capability:** Programmatically ingests state spatial datasets (NSW SEED Portal hydrography & biodiversity layers, Lake Macquarie City Council open data, ABS Meshblocks).
  * **Benefit:** Eliminates manual data downloads and stale local copies; ensures planning decisions are executed against up-to-date authoritative government spatial APIs.

* **Automated Environmental Buffer & Constraint Masking:**
  * **Capability:** Dynamically constructs precision buffer zones (e.g., 50m riparian corridors, 100m biodiversity protection buffers, mine subsidence exclusion zones).
  * **Benefit:** Ensures strict adherence to environmental legislation and biodiversity offset rules prior to detailed precinct design.

---

### 3. Land Administration & Cadastre (Spatial Services NSW / DCDB)
* **High-Scale Cadastral & Meshblock Spatial Joins:**
  * **Capability:** Leverages distributed spatial index matching (`R-Tree` / `Quad-Tree`) via Apache Sedona to execute spatial joins over state-wide cadastre (~3.5M+ land parcels in NSW) without memory overflow or process crashes.
  * **Benefit:** Enables rapid attribute enrichment across the entire NSW Digital Cadastral Data Base (DCDB) and ABS Meshblocks.

* **Rigorous Native Projection & Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Management:**
  * **Capability:** Robust, programmatic handling of Australian spatial standards (`EPSG:7856` - GDA2020 / MGA Zone 56 to `EPSG:4326` WGS84) with automated geometry validation (`ST_IsValid`, `ST_MakeValid`).
  * **Benefit:** Guarantees sub-meter positional accuracy required for land administration and legal cadastral overlays.

---

### 4. Enterprise Spatial IT, Spatial Digital Twin & Open Standards
* **Open Formats & Interoperability (GeoParquet):**
  * **Capability:** Exports clean spatial datasets in cloud-native **GeoParquet**, reading/writing seamlessly into QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, DuckDB, Python, and web viewers.
  * **Benefit:** Breaks down file geodatabase vendor lock-in and optimizes storage/query performance for the **NSW Spatial Digital Twin**.

* **Auditability & DevOps Infrastructure:**
  * **Capability:** Replaces black-box desktop geoprocessing tools with version-controlled Python/SQL scripts, Jupyter notebooks (`Macquarie_Coal_Complex_Spatial_ETL.ipynb`), and lightweight HTML status runners (`macquarie_etl_runner.html`).
  * **Benefit:** Fully reproducible pipelines for government audit standards, continuous integration (CI/CD), and automated night runs.

* **Cloud Resource Safety & Cost Control:**
  * **Capability:** Includes built-in cluster teardown hooks (`sedona.stop()`, `spark.stop()`) and resource budget safeguards.
  * **Benefit:** Prevents cloud computing budget overruns on Wherobots, AWS, or Azure platforms.

## Practical Pilot Opportunities for NSW Spatial Services & DPHI

1. **State-Wide Net Developable Area Pipeline:** Adapt `src/Ingestion/macquarie_spatial_ingest.py` to ingest the state-wide DCDB and SEED layers to create an automated NDA service for all NSW Growth Areas and REZs.
2. **Spatial Digital Twin Lakehouse Connector:** Deploy the Sedona / Wherobots GeoParquet pipeline to stream processed spatial analytics layers directly into the NSW Spatial Digital Twin platform.
3. **Automated Land Siting for Renewable Energy & Infrastructure:** Use `src/Analysis/national_suitability_analysis.py` to evaluate candidate sites for battery storage, transmission corridors, or public infrastructure against multi-layer constraints.
